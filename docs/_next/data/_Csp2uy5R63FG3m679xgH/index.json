There are a series of exciting phases that we've codified in three planned releases."},{"id":"summarization-design","title":"Summarization Design","date":"2020-07-27","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"In designing the summarization aspect to discussions, we've been faced with a plethora of options regarding both how the summary is created from existing blocks, and how it evolves as participants make edits."},{"id":"summarization-and-moderation","title":"Summarization and Moderation","date":"2020-07-20","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"The bulk of phase II is summarization. Phase 1 focused on how people interact through the familiar interface of chat. Through phase II, we will be building a space for them to develop an ongoing-summary of their conversation."},{"id":"outlining-phase-2","title":"Outlining Phase II of Prototyping","date":"2020-07-06","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"Having built a working prototype of the core chat functionality in Pith, we're moving on to the next phase of development in which we will address issues raised with the prototype so far and introduce summarization."},{"id":"testing-phase-1","title":"Feedback from Testing Phase I","date":"2020-06-28","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"We tested the prototype website chat with a group of people informally. We gave them some time to chat among themselves and explore the features organically. People were able to pick up how to use multiple blocks in a post and tags fairly quickly."},{"id":"transclusion","title":"Adding Transclusion","date":"2020-06-21","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"We've recently been working on adding a kind of hyperlinking functionality to the Pith prototype, called transclusion. Often, authors will want to quote a previous post and will cut out a section of it as a reference"},{"id":"considering-searching","title":"Considering Searching","date":"2020-06-14","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"We plan for our system to have many discussions going on at the same time. In a discussion, users can easily create posts which have smaller units of content called blocks."},{"id":"basic-functionality","title":"Adding Basic Functionality to the Test Object","date":"2020-06-14","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"We've begun to integrate some of the functionality from last week's post into the test object. At the moment the goal is to keep the development focused on getting the essential features roughly implemented, and then coming back later and adding a minimum amount of styling to increase the functionality of the prototype as an object to be evaluated by our testers."},{"id":"test-object","title":"Designing a First Test Object","date":"2020-06-07","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"To begin to test out some of the features we've designed, we're creating a small protoype of the discussion interface. This test suite will serve as a way of evaluating the following design choices and features."},{"id":"conversational-design","title":"First Draft of Conversational Design","date":"2020-05-31","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"We've outlined a few goals for the design of the conversation in addition to features that help address them.  The system should be online to allow an arbitrary number of people anywhere to converse with each other."},{"id":"representing-discussion","title":"Representing Discussion","date":"2020-05-24","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"How do we represent discussion in a way people can easily interact with? Discussion is more than just decision-making/debating. There are also the small conversations around this high-level process when people come to agreement on the meaning of related concepts"},{"id":"pith-intro","title":"Pith: What is It?","date":"2020-05-18","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"Pith is an experimental method of facilitating discussions between many people online, building on the notion of an electronic direct democracy.
