<p>We want to design the basic framework for this purpose that can then be applied in numerous settings, such as for corporate, for open-source problem-solving, for more casual exploration of other people's experiences.</p>
<h2>Representing Perspectives</h2>
<p>There are two key ideas to do this. </p>
<ol>
<li>How can we identify under-examined perspectives?</li>
<li>How can we help bridge perspectives that have not been in contact, especially if each perspective has something important to contribute to the other?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summarizing a Large Discussion</h2>
<p>A summary makes a discussion more digestible to everyone. If a community agrees a decision should be made off a summary, then it should be clear to everyone through what justification people make their decisions.</p>
<p>The summary can better represent the distribution of perspectives because of the prior point.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>We are experimenting with several ideas for achieving these main two objectives.</p>
<p>Here we explain the general architecture of the design so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as before, we have small discussions with at most ten people.</li>
<li>Each discussion can make a summary for the purpose of keeping of record of the discussion itself. The summary is composed of summary-blocks, which are transcluded from the discussion and edited in the summary if need be.</li>
<li>The discussion members are encouraged to "summarize" the salient points of their discussion to the general community. They do this by creating a select few "super-blocks", each of which should represent a discrete idea.</li>
<li>The super-blocks are semantically organized in a network with super-blocks from other discussions. Therefore, we see the semantic landscape of salient points throughout discussions. The exact method for how super-blocks are placed in semantic space is yet to be determined.</li>
<li>Super-blocks are linked to the discussion summary, which is linked to all super blocks from the discussion. Sections of the summary can be treated as an extension of super-blocks. For example, a super-block can express something such as "whales are great", and the summary can argue why.</li>
<li>In the network, super-blocks are connected if they came from the same discussion.</li>
<li>Therefore, there are two types of bonds: a semantic one and a co-mentioned one.</li>
<li>The platform automatically detects certain patterns, like which semantic spaces (topics) have not been co-mentioned much with which other topics, or not co-mentioned with other topics in general and are relatively isolated.</li>
<li>Humans exploring the network, and with the help of the automated patterns, identify which topics are underrepresented or could be bridged with another topic.</li>
<li>Topics that are underrepresented or can be bridged can be "pinned" on the board and prioritized as a starting point for the spawning of new discussions. The board can ultimately allow people to "meta-discuss" what needs attention,.</li>
<li>When these new discussions are formed, they create a new kind of link that shows they are inspired or transcluded from the topics.</li>
<li>Within a discussion, people can explore the network and use it to inspire their current discussion. If they want to reference particular super-blocks, that is also a transclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note there are several keys issues that need to be solved.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>How are super-blocks semantically organized together?</li>
<li>How are "topics" identified, if they should be identified in a coherent way?</li>
<li>How can we help people search the network without getting overwhelmed?<ul>
<li>If a discussion's creation was inspired from several super-blocks, it is likely helpful that people should explore super-blocks that are semantically similar to those inspirational super-blocks. If people transclude super-blocks during the conversation, these super-blocks are also gateways to more semantically super-blocks.</li>
<li>It may also be helpful if people explore the co-mention links from these super-blocks, to see in which context particular super-blocks could have come up in.</li>
<li>If people have general topics they want to explore, perhaps a keyword or traditional semantic search of the blocks can help them find a starting point in the network to search around.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When people search the network, how is it visually presented?<ul>
<li>Is it a list, like how a search engine could present results?</li>
<li>Is it a network, which may emphasis the links or the topology of the space more than the nodes (results)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
